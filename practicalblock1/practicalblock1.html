    Express  Node.js  React  Summary

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    Express
    
        A minimal back-end framework for the Node.js runtime environment, Express uses shorter lines of code to make
            for simpler development. Express is open-source and uses JavaScript. Express can create APIs and single- and
            multi-page applications in a straightforward and organized way.
            
        Express's development tools are intuitive and easy to use for newer or inexperienced developers. While
            developers can customize their applications, the framework includes many pre-built functions and engine
            templates for faster use.
 
    <!-- Section 2 -->
    Node.js

        Node.js is an open-source server environment that uses JavaScript to create dynamic page content on various
            platforms. Ideal for multi-user communication apps, such as social media, multiplayer games, and chat apps,
            this framework can manage many connections at once.

        Node.js allows for two-way communication and offers push capabilities. With an easier learning curve than
            other frameworks, developers can spend less time on development overall.

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    React

        React is an open-source front-end web framework that excels in creating mobile and single-page applications.
            The extensive user interface library features a reliable support system and comprehensive resources, along
            with a huge component library. Developers can also access powerful third-party developer tools and plugins.
  
        React allows developers to save time in various ways, including using reusable code and virtual DOM. This
            system tests proposed changes and determines the most effective way to apply them ahead of time, getting rid
            of possible mistakes and performance downgrades.
